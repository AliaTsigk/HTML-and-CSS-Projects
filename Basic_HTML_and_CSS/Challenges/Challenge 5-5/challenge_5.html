            <p>1. I don't want to control you.</p>
            <p>2. I feel powerless to stop myself from calling or texting when I'm panicking about us.</p>
            <p>3. I wish I had more self-control.</p>
            <p>4. I wish I didn't need everything so intensely.</p>
            <p>5. Your independence is something I truly admire.</p>
            <p>6. I don't want you to think that you're not a good partner when I bring up my concerns.</p>
            <p>7. I'm so thankful that you have patience when I'm anxious.</p>
