	  <h1>One of my favorite breeds is Golden Retrievers</h1>
	  
	  <p>I also love Canadian timber wolves and Cane Corsos. Here's a link to the Golden Retrievers that I like:

	  <p>Where did the phrase “man’s best friend” come from? Here's a little read through:</p>
	  <blockquote cite="https://www.rover.com/blog/dogs-called-mans-best-friend/">The phrase “man’s best friend” originated in the American Supreme Court in 1870 when a talented lawyer named George Graham Vest 
	    defended a man who deeply loved his coon hound named Old Drum. Vest argued that when a neighbor killed Old Drum for trespassing, the neighbor took the life of more than just a pet—he killed an important 
		family member. Vest famously stated, “The one absolute, unselfish friend that man can have in this selfish world—the one that never proves ungrateful or treacherous—is his dog.”
